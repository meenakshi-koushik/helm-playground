# Helm Playground

A starter repo for learning and experimenting with helm

## Pre-requisites

* A kubernetes cluster and `kubectl`. 
  * The [install tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) section of kubernetes docs has instructions to setup kubectl and spin up a local cluster.
  * See [hello minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/) kubernetes tutorial for one way to setup a test cluster from within the browser. 
  * You could also use any kubernetes cluster hosted on e.g., AWS, Azure


* `helm` - see [helm.sh](https://helm.sh) for installation instructions.
